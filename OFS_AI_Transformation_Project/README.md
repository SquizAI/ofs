## Key Highlights

### The Problem

The current Fast Furniture Estimator:
- ❌ Requires 30-60 minutes of manual data entry per estimate
- ❌ Uses static templates with no intelligence
- ❌ Is gated behind rep approval
- ❌ Lacks collaboration and integration capabilities
- ❌ Provides minimal visualization

### The Solution

An AI-powered platform that:
- ✅ Reduces estimate time from 45 min → 8 min (82% faster)
- ✅ Uses conversational AI for natural language input
- ✅ Analyzes floor plans with computer vision
- ✅ Generates multiple budget scenarios automatically
- ✅ Validates ADA and building code compliance
- ✅ Creates photorealistic 3D, AR, and VR visualizations
- ✅ Tracks sustainability impact (carbon footprint, certifications)
- ✅ Orchestrates end-to-end procurement and installation
- ✅ Learns from every project to improve recommendations

---

## Business Impact

### Revenue Growth: $53.5M/year

- **Increased Win Rate:** +$13.5M (36% → 45% conversion)
- **Expanded Reach:** +$30M (500 → 10,000 users)
- **Intelligent Upselling:** +$10M (15% larger deals)

### Cost Savings: $2.7M/year

- **Operational Efficiency:** $1.9M (automated estimation)
- **Error Reduction:** $300K (fewer change orders)
