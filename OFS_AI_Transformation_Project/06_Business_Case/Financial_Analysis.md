## Revenue Model

### Revenue Impact Drivers

#### 1. Increased Win Rate: +$13.5M/year

**Current State:**
- Annual proposals: 1,000
- Average deal size: $150K
- Total quote value: $150M
- Win rate: 36%
- **Current revenue: $54M**

**Future State (with AI):**
- Win rate: 45% (+25% improvement)
- **New revenue: $67.5M**
- **Incremental: $13.5M**

**Win Rate Improvement Drivers:**
- Faster response times (24-hour turnaround vs. 3-5 days)
- Professional presentations (3D/AR vs. static PDFs)
- More scenarios explored (5 vs. 1 average)
- Data-driven confidence in recommendations
- Better stakeholder collaboration

**Conservative Adjustment:**
Assume 50% realization in Year 1 = **$6.75M**

---

#### 2. Market Expansion: +$30M/year

**Current State:**
- Gated access: 500 approved users
- Rep approval required
- High barrier to entry
- Limited self-service

**Future State (with AI):**
- Self-service platform: 10,000+ users (20x growth)
- Instant access (no rep approval)
- Viral sharing and referrals
- Lower customer acquisition cost

**Revenue Calculation:**
- Incremental users: 9,500
- Average revenue per user (ARPU): $4,000/year
  - Assumption: 25% of users convert to customers
  - Average purchase: $16K
- **Total: 9,500 × 0.25 × $16K = $38M**

**Conservative Adjustment:**
Assume 50% ramp-up in Year 1 + 25% conversion = **$19M**

*Further conservative adjustment to $15M to account for lower early conversion*

---

#### 3. Intelligent Upselling: +$10M/year

**Mechanism:**
- AI recommends complementary products
- Bundle suggestions (desk + storage + lighting)
- Premium alternatives with value justification
- Accessories and add-ons

**Impact:**
- Average deal size increase: 15%
- Base revenue impacted: $67.5M (new win rate)
- **Incremental: $10.1M**

**Conservative Adjustment:**
Assume 50% effectiveness in Year 1 = **$5M**
