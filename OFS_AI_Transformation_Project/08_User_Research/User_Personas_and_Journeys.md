## Design Implications

### UX Principles

Based on user research, the platform must:

1. **Respect User Expertise**
   - AI as assistant, not replacement
   - Always allow manual override
   - Explain recommendations, don't dictate

2. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Simple by default, powerful when needed
   - Hide complexity until user asks for it
   - Onboarding flow for different skill levels

3. **Mobile-First Mindset**
   - Not just responsive, but mobile-native
