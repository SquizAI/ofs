## Frequently Asked Questions

### Strategic Questions

**Q: Why now? Why not wait for competitors to validate the market?**
A: First-mover advantage provides 2-3 year lead. Waiting allows competitors to capture market share and establish AI-powered workflows as their competitive differentiation.

**Q: What if the AI doesn't work as well as expected?**
A: Multi-phased approach allows course correction. Phase 1 MVP validates core assumptions. Human-in-the-loop design ensures quality even with imperfect AI.

**Q: How do we protect this investment if AI technology changes rapidly?**
A: Modular architecture allows swapping AI models. Focus on workflow and UX, not specific AI vendors. Continuous improvement process adapts to new capabilities.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why build vs. buy?**
A: No commercial solutions exist for furniture-specific AI agents. Building provides competitive moat and control over IP. Estimated 3-5x ROI vs. licensing fees.

**Q: What about data privacy and security?**
A: SOC 2 Type II compliance, end-to-end encryption, GDPR/CCPA adherence. Client data isolated by tenant. No training on proprietary client data without consent.

**Q: Can we integrate with existing systems?**
A: Yes. API-first architecture with pre-built integrations for major CAD/BIM, CRM, and ERP systems. Custom integration support available.

### Business Questions

**Q: How quickly will we see ROI?**
A: 10-month payback period. Early wins in sales cycle reduction and win rate improvement deliver value in months 4-6.

**Q: What's the risk if this fails?**
A: $4.5M Year 1 investment. Mitigated by phased approach with go/no-go gates. Worst case: salvage core platform technology for other uses.

**Q: How does this affect our dealer channel?**
A: Enhances dealer capabilities, increasing their preference for OFS products. Platform becomes dealer recruitment and retention tool.
